## Project Goal
:point_right: The goal of this data analysis is to study the relationship between error monitoring and academic achievement in post-kindergarten children with ASD by investigating ERP/EEG patterns related to error monitoring (ERN, Pe, theta power). 


## Background & Design
Prior studies have shown the presence of an ERN and Pe (ERP/EEG patterns related to error monitoring) in typically developing preschoolers and a significant association between these patterns and academic achievement ([Grammer, Carrasco, Gehring, & Morrison, 2014]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4061373/) and [M. Kim et al., 2016]( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27744098/)). Moreover, Pe and ERN have been detected in children with ASD ([S.H. Kim, Grammer, Benrey, Morrison, & Lord, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28949003/)) and the predictability of concurrent academic achievement based on Pe and theta power has been proved in pre-kindergartener children with ASD ([S. H. Kim et al, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361319874920?journalCode=auta)).
