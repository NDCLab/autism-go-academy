## Project Goal
The goal of this data analysis is to study the differences in theta rhythms between post-kindergarten children with typical development (TD) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to better understand cognitive control in children with ASD. 


## Background & Design

Prior studies in typically developing children, adolescents, and adults have shown that medio-frontal cortex (MFC) theta oscillations are associated with cognitive control. It has also been found that children with ASD have cognitive control impairments. However, it is not clear how and when cognitive control tasks are impaired in individuals with ASD. To better understand cognitive control in children with ASD, task-related MFC theta power was directly compared in TD and ASD pre-kindergarten children in our prior study ([Buzzell, G. A., Thomas, H. R., Choi, Y. B., & Kim, S. H. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.03.016)). In that study, we found that reduced theta power in ASD children compared to TD children. To further investigate the differences in theta rhythms between TD and ASD children, we will use time-frequency analyses to evaluate possible differences in phase synchrony, as well as MFC theta power differences, in post-kindergarten children.
