## Project Goal
The goal of this data analysis project is to investigate potential differences in cognitive control and task-related mediofrontal theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations among post-kindergarten children that are either typically developing (TD) or diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).


## Background & Design

Prior studies in typically developing children, adolescents, and adults have shown that mediofrontal theta oscillations are associated with cognitive control. It has also been found that children with ASD exhibit cognitive control impairments. However, it is not clear how and when cognitive control tasks are impaired in individuals with ASD. To better understand cognitive control in children with ASD, task-related MFC theta power was directly compared in TD and ASD pre-kindergarten children in our prior study ([Buzzell, G. A., Thomas, H. R., Choi, Y. B., & Kim, S. H. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.03.016)). In this prior study, we identified  reduced theta power in ASD children compared to TD children. To further investigate the differences in theta oscillations between TD and ASD children, we will use time-frequency analyses to evaluate possible differences in mediofrontal theta power and phase synchrony, in a longitudinal dataset spanning pre-post-kindergarten.
