## Project Goal
The goal of this data analysis is to study the differences of Theta rhythms between post-kindergarten TD and ASD children to better understand cognitive control among children with ASD. 


## Background & Design

Prior studies in typically developing children, adolescents, and adults have shown that medio-frontal cortex (MFC) Theta oscillations are associated with cognitive control. It has also been found that children with ASD have cognitive control impairments. However, it is not clear how and when cognitive control tasks are impaired in individuals with ASD. To better understand the cognitive control in children with ASD, task-related MFC theta power was directly compared in TD and ASD pre-kindergarten children in our prior study [Buzzell, G. A., Thomas, H. R., Choi, Y. B., & Kim, S. H. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.03.016). In that study, we found that theta power is reduced in ASD compared to TD children. To further investigate the differences of theta rhythms between TD and ASD children, we will analyze our EEG data set using time-frequency analyses to evaluate whether there are differences in phase synchrony and how these (i.e. MFC theta power differences and phase synchrony) change over time to know if they show different developmental patterns.
